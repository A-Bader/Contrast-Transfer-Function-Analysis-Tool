Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) Analysis Tool

We present an automated analysis tool designed to generate reproducible CTFs for various types of HMDs. The CTF analysis tool processes the acquired images from the HMD display. 
To compute CTF of the HMD, a grille pattern with equal width white and black bars in the vertical or horizontal direction are displayed on the HMD screen. 
The varying widths of the bars correspond to different spatial frequency values, representing different cycles per degree, allowing for the measurement of Michelson contrast at these spatial frequencies.
This tool is developed as a general method that can be applied to a wide variety of HMDs, encompassing different design and display technologies to generate reproducible CTFs.

Installation: Instal CTF Tool Installer.exe file.

Usage instruction: User manaul is avaiable with installation steps and uasge steps.
